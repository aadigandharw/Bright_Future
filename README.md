# Bright_Future
Internship at YashviTech Grateful for the opportunity to intern at YashviTech, where I worked under the guidance of Harish Sir and Vikash Sir. During this time, I enhanced my frontend development skills, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Their mentorship helped me understand core web development concepts and build real-world projects.
